					nerdy things you love and uses that as the lyrical themes while employing rock music of all styles. They 
					combine the two into an awesome sonic experience for their fans . Sci-Fried&#39;s stage show is accompanied 
					by video to fully immerse the audience into the world of Nerd Music and Sci-Fried.

					Sci-Fried has released five albums and one DVD since their launch in 2008. <em>Ramming Speed</em> is an all 
					parody CD based on a wide variety of popular classic and modern rock songs. <em>Geeks Unite</em> was the

					things geek as lyrical themes. Their third album, <em>Future Tense</em>, explores the past and future state 
					of Science Fiction in a variety of musical styles that demonstrates the band&#39;s growth and continuing 
					diversity musically and lyrically. In 2012 Sci-Fried released <em>Co-Op Mode</em>. An all collaboration 
					album with some of the hottest names in Nerd Music. MC Lars, Warp 11 and Kirby Krackle are just a few on 
					<em>Co-Op Mode</em> that Sci-Fried was able to work with. The <em>Sci-Fried Music Video Collective vol. 1 DVD </em> contains over 11 Music Videos and over 90 minutes of total video. Then in 2014 Sci-Fried released
